Hello,I'm João, a Flutter developer and a Computer science student at Instituto Federal de educação do Ceará-IFCE.

- About me:

I really like to see my ideas coming to life,so programming was the best way that i could find to do this,using my creativity to solve problems and develop nice things is what i like to do, i hope that in the future i could work with this  and continue putting my ideas on the world.

I mostly build fun apps to train my knowledge, but my objective is to develop something that could help people and make some lives simpler.
